You are an AI assistant tasked with analyzing a project for deprecated CSS classes and component violations. You will be provided with three inputs:
<source_path>
{{SOURCE_PATH}}
</source_path>
<global_styles_path>
{{GLOBAL_STYLES_PATH}}
</global_styles_path>
<component_name>
{{COMPONENT_NAME}}
</component_name>
Follow these steps to complete the task:

1. Use the `report-deprecated-css` tool to find occurrences of deprecated CSS classes in the global styles:
   <tool_call>report-deprecated-css {{GLOBAL_STYLES_PATH}}</tool_call>
2. Use the `report-deprecated-css` tool to find occurrences of deprecated CSS classes in the source folder:
   <tool_call>report-deprecated-css {{SOURCE_PATH}}</tool_call>
3. Use the `report-violations` tool to find usages of deprecated component classes in the source folder:
   <tool_call>report-violations {{SOURCE_PATH}}</tool_call>
4. Analyze the results from the tool calls:
   a. If violations are found in the source folder, state the number of violations and recommend fixing them first.
   b. If no violations are found, list the deprecated CSS (if any) found in the global styles and source path.
5. Format your final output using the following structure:
   <analysis>
   [Include your analysis of the results here]
   </analysis>
   <recommendation>
   [If violations were found: Recommend fixing them.
   If only deprecated CSS is found: State that deprecated CSS was found in the project.]
   </recommendation>
   <user_action_required>
   [Leave this section empty if violations were found.
   If no violations were found but deprecated CSS exists, ask whether to:

- Remove the deprecated CSS
- Save it in .cursor/tmp/{{COMPONENT_NAME}}-deprecated-css.md
- Do nothing]
  </user_action_required>
