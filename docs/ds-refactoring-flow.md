# Design System Refactoring Flow


## Overview

This document describes a 5-step AI-assisted refactoring process for migrating legacy components to the design system. Each step uses a specific rule file (.mdc) that guides the Cursor agent through automated analysis and code changes.

**Process Summary:**
1. **Find Violations** ‚Üí Identify deprecated component usage
2. **Plan Refactoring** ‚Üí Create detailed migration strategy  
   - **If viable:** Proceed to step 3 with normal checklist
   - **If non-viable:** Use alternative handling (see Non-Viable Cases section below)
3. **Fix Violations** ‚Üí Execute code changes
4. **Validate Changes** ‚Üí Verify refactoring safety
5. **Prepare Report** ‚Üí Generate testing checklists and documentation

The process includes three quality gates where human review and approval are required. When components are identified as non-viable during planning, an alternative handling process is used instead of proceeding to the normal fix violations step.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the refactoring flow, ensure you have:
- Cursor IDE with this MCP (Model Context Protocol) server connected. This flow was tested with Cursor but should also work with Windsurf or Copilot.
- The five rule files (.mdc) available in your workspace
- A git branch for the refactoring work

## 01-find-violations.mdc

### Goal

Identify and locate legacy component usage in a codebase to prepare for systematic refactoring. This rule helps developers find deprecated design system components and their usage patterns across the project in a structured, two-step process.

### Process

To start this process, drag file `01-find-violations.mdc` to the cursor chat and provide `directory` and `component` parameters, your chat message will look like this 

```
@01-find-violations.mdc directory=path/to/directory component=DsComponent
```

This rule follows a two-step process to find violations:

**Step 1: Folder-level scan**
- Scans the specified directory for component violations grouped by folder
- Provides a ranked list of folders with violation counts
- Allows user to select a specific subfolder for detailed analysis

**Step 2: File-level scan**
- Performs detailed scanning of the selected subfolder
- Groups violations by individual files
- Outputs a sorted list of files with violation counts
- Prepares the transition to the planning phase

> After the second scan, AI will explicitly ask you to attach the second rule for planning.

### Tools used

- `report-violations` - Main MCP tool that analyzes deprecated design system CSS usage
  - Parameters: `componentName`, `directory`, `groupBy` (folder/file)
  - Returns violation data with counts and locations
  - Supports both folder-level and file-level grouping

### Flow

> You don't need to manually perform any of the listed actions except providing the `component=DsComponent directory=path/to/folder` in the initial message.

1. **Initial Setup**: User provides `{{COMPONENT_NAME}}` and `{{DIRECTORY}}` parameters
2. **Folder Scan**: Execute `report-violations` with `groupBy: "folder"`
3. **Error Handling**: Check for tool errors or zero violations
4. **Folder Results**: Display ranked folder list with violation counts
5. **User Selection**: Prompt user to choose a subfolder for detailed analysis
6. **File Scan**: Execute `report-violations` with `groupBy: "file"` on selected subfolder
7. **File Results**: Display sorted file list with violation counts
8. **Transition**: Prompt user to attach "Plan Phase" rules for next step

The rule enforces strict output formatting with `<folders>` and `<violations>` tags, and uses `<commentary>` blocks for error messages and clarifications.

## 02-plan-refactoring.mdc

### Goal

Create a comprehensive migration plan for refactoring legacy components to new design system components. This rule analyzes the current codebase, evaluates migration complexity, and provides a detailed, actionable plan with specific steps, classifications, and verification notes for each affected file.

### Process

To start this process, drag file `02-plan-refactoring.mdc` to the cursor chat.

The rule implements a three-phase migration planning process:

**Phase 1: Comprehensive Analysis**
- Reviews component documentation, implementation code, and usage patterns
- Analyzes all affected files (templates, TypeScript, styles, specs, NgModules)
- Assesses migration complexity and identifies potential non-viable migrations
- Evaluates library dependencies and their impact on migration

**Phase 2: Detailed Plan Creation**
- Compares old markup against design system exemplars
- Classifies each migration as: Simple swap, Requires restructure, or Non-viable
- Assigns complexity scores (1-10) with penalties for animations/breakpoints/variants
- Creates actionable plans ordered by effort with concrete edits needed
- Provides verification notes for static file-based checks

---
**üö¶ Quality Gate 1**

Before proceeding to Phase 3, you must review the migration plan.

**Required Actions:**
- Review the suggested plan thoroughly
- **If components are viable for migration:** Approve or request modifications, then proceed with checklist creation
- **If components are non-viable:** Developer must thoroughly review and confirm non-viability, then use `@03-non-viable-cases.mdc` instead of normal checklist
- Clarify any uncertainties

**Next Step:** 
- **Viable migrations:** When satisfied with the plan, the agent will create a checklist
- **Non-viable migrations:** Use the non-viable cases rule instead of proceeding to fix violations
---

**Phase 3: Checklist Creation**
- Generates comprehensive checklist of actual changes as checkboxes
- Creates verification phase with static checks that can be performed by reading files
- Saves checklist to `.cursor/tmp/refactoring-checklist-{{FOLDER_PATH}}.md`

> After the checklist is generated and you see it in the chat, it is time to attach the next rule.

### Tools used

- `get-ds-component-data` - Retrieves comprehensive component information
  - Returns: implementation files, documentation files, import paths
  - Provides: component source code, API documentation, usage examples

- `build-component-usage-graph` - Maps component dependencies and usage
  - Parameters: `directory`, `violationFiles` (from previous step, automatically picked up)
  - Returns: graph showing where components are imported and used
  - Analyzes: modules, specs, templates, styles, reverse dependencies

- `get-project-dependencies` - Analyzes project structure and dependencies
  - Parameters: `directory`, optional `componentName`
  - Returns: library type (buildable/publishable), peer dependencies
  - Validates: import paths, workspace configuration

### Flow

> You don't need to manually perform any of the listed actions.

1. **Input Gathering**: Collect component name, folder path, documentation, code, usage graph, and library data
2. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Review all inputs and analyze codebase impact
3. **Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate migration difficulty and identify non-viable cases
4. **File Classification**: Categorize each file's migration requirements
5. **Plan Creation**: Generate detailed migration steps with complexity scores
6. **Verification Design**: Create static checks for plan validation
7. **Ambiguity Resolution**: Identify and request clarification for unclear aspects
8. **Approval Process**: Present plan with "üõ†Ô∏è Approve this plan or specify adjustments?"
9. **Checklist Generation**: Create actionable checklist after approval
10. **File Persistence**: Save checklist to temporary file for reference

The rule enforces structured output with `<comprehensive_analysis>`, `<migration_plan>`, and `<checklist>` tags, and includes built-in ambiguity safeguards.

## Non-Viable Cases Handling

### When to Use

During the **02-plan-refactoring.mdc** step, if the AI identifies components as non-viable for migration, this must be **thoroughly reviewed by an actual developer**. Only after developer confirmation should you proceed with non-viable handling instead of the normal checklist confirmation.

### Process

When non-viable cases are confirmed during planning, instead of proceeding with the normal checklist, use the non-viable cases rule:
- Reference: `@03-non-viable-cases.mdc` (or `@03-non-viable-cases.mdc` depending on your rule setup)
- **Critical:** This replaces the normal "Fix Violations" step entirely

The rule implements a systematic three-phase process for handling non-migratable components:

**Phase 1: Identification & Discovery**
- Identifies the target component class name from conversation context
- Runs CSS discovery using `report-deprecated-css` tool on both global styles and style overrides directories
- Creates a comprehensive implementation checklist with validation checks
- Saves checklist to `.cursor/tmp/css-cleanup/[class-name]-[scope]-non-viable-migration-checklist.md`

**Phase 2: Implementation**
- Works systematically from the saved checklist file
- **Step 1: HTML Template Updates (FIRST PRIORITY)**
  - Replaces original component classes with `after-migration-[ORIGINAL_CLASS]` in HTML files/templates
  - Must be done BEFORE any CSS changes to ensure consistency
- **Step 2: CSS Selector Duplication (NOT REPLACEMENT)**
  - Duplicates CSS selectors rather than replacing them
  - Transforms: `.custom-radio {}` ‚Üí `.custom-radio, .after-migration-custom-radio {}`
  - Maintains visual parity between original and prefixed versions

**Phase 3: Validation (Mandatory)**
- **Validation 1 - CSS Count Consistency**: Re-runs `report-deprecated-css` tool to verify deprecated class count remains identical
- **Validation 2 - Violation Reduction**: Runs `report-violations` tool to verify the expected reduction in violations
- Updates checklist with validation results and marks all items complete

### Key Features

**Exclusion Strategy**: The `after-migration-` prefix serves as a marker that excludes these components from future violation reports, effectively removing them from the migration pipeline while preserving functionality.

**Visual Consistency**: By duplicating CSS selectors rather than replacing them, the workflow ensures that both the original classes and the new prefixed classes render identically.

**Comprehensive Tracking**: The workflow maintains detailed checklists and validation steps to ensure all instances are properly handled and tracked.

**Error Prevention**: Systematic validation ensures that the transformation doesn't break existing functionality or miss any instances.

### Tools used

- `report-deprecated-css` - Identifies deprecated CSS classes in style directories
  - Parameters: `directory`, `componentName`
  - Returns: List of deprecated CSS usage with file locations and line numbers
  - Used for: Discovery phase and validation of CSS count consistency

- `report-violations` - Analyzes deprecated component usage in templates and code
  - Parameters: `directory`, `componentName`  
  - Returns: List of component violations with file locations
  - Used for: Validation of violation reduction after implementation

### Flow

> You don't need to manually perform any of the listed actions except providing directory paths when requested.

1. **Component Identification**: Extract target component class name from conversation context
2. **Directory Input**: Request global styles and style overrides directories from user (with fallback handling)
3. **CSS Discovery**: Run parallel `report-deprecated-css` scans on both directories
4. **Checklist Creation**: Generate comprehensive implementation checklist with validation checks
5. **HTML Updates**: Replace component classes with `after-migration-` prefixed versions in templates
6. **CSS Duplication**: Add prefixed selectors alongside original selectors in CSS files
7. **Validation Execution**: Run mandatory validation checks using actual tools
8. **Progress Tracking**: Update checklist file throughout the process with completion status
9. **Final Verification**: Confirm all validation criteria are met before completion

The rule enforces structured output with `<target_component>`, `<checklist_summary>`, `<validation_1>`, and `<validation_2>` tags, and maintains strict validation criteria to ensure process integrity.

### When to Use This Workflow

This workflow should be used when:
- A component is identified as non-viable for migration during the planning phase
- Legacy components cannot be updated due to technical constraints
- Components need to be excluded from future violation reports
- Maintaining existing visual appearance is critical during transition periods

### Integration with Main Flow

This handling is integrated within the design system refactoring process:
- **Decision Point**: During `02-plan-refactoring.mdc` when components are classified as "Non-viable"
- **Developer Review Required**: Must be thoroughly reviewed and approved by actual developer before proceeding
- **Replaces Steps 3-5**: When used, this replaces the normal Fix Violations ‚Üí Validate Changes ‚Üí Prepare Report sequence
- **Outcome**: Successfully processed components will be excluded from subsequent violation reports

## clean-global-styles.mdc (Independent Step)

### Goal

Analyze a project for deprecated CSS classes and component violations to provide a comprehensive assessment of design system migration readiness. This rule serves as a preliminary analysis step that can be used independently of the main refactoring flow to understand the scope of deprecated usage across both global styles and component-specific code.

### Process

To start this process, drag file `clean-global-styles.mdc` to the cursor chat and provide the required parameters:

```
directory=path/to/source/directory
stylesDirectory=path/to/global/styles/directory  
componentName=DsComponentName

@clean-global-styles.mdc
```

This rule follows a three-step analysis process:

**Step 1: Global Styles Analysis**
- Scans the global styles directory for deprecated CSS classes
- Identifies occurrences of deprecated classes across all style files
- Reports file locations and line numbers for each violation

**Step 2: Source Directory Analysis**
- Scans the source directory for deprecated CSS classes in component styles
- Identifies deprecated CSS usage in component-specific style files
- Reports violations with precise file and line information

**Step 3: Component Violations Analysis**
- Scans the source directory for deprecated component usage in templates and TypeScript files
- Identifies HTML elements and TypeScript code using deprecated classes
- Reports violations with context about where deprecated components are used

### Tools used

- `report-deprecated-css` - Analyzes deprecated CSS classes in style files
  - Parameters: `directory`, `componentName`
  - Returns: List of deprecated CSS class usage with file locations and line numbers
  - Scans: .scss, .sass, .less, .css files for deprecated class selectors

- `report-violations` - Analyzes deprecated component usage in templates and code
  - Parameters: `directory`, `componentName`
  - Returns: List of component violations with file locations and line numbers
  - Scans: .html, .ts files for deprecated component usage in templates and inline templates

### Flow

> You don't need to manually perform any of the listed actions except providing the initial parameters.

1. **Parameter Setup**: User provides `{{SOURCE_PATH}}`, `{{GLOBAL_STYLES_PATH}}`, and `{{COMPONENT_NAME}}`
2. **Global Styles Scan**: Execute `report-deprecated-css` on global styles directory
3. **Source Directory Scan**: Execute `report-deprecated-css` on source directory
4. **Component Violations Scan**: Execute `report-violations` on source directory
5. **Results Analysis**: Analyze all findings and determine next steps
6. **Recommendation Generation**: Provide structured recommendations based on findings
7. **User Action Decision**: Present options for handling deprecated CSS if no violations found

### Output Structure

The rule provides structured output with three key sections:

**Analysis Section**
- Summary of violations found in source folder
- Count and distribution of deprecated CSS occurrences
- Assessment of migration readiness

**Recommendation Section**
- Priority actions based on findings
- Guidance on whether to fix violations first or clean up deprecated CSS
- Strategic recommendations for migration approach

**User Action Required Section**
- Interactive options when no violations are found but deprecated CSS exists
- Choices for handling deprecated CSS (remove, save, or ignore)
- Clear next steps for the user

### Decision Tree

The rule follows a decision tree approach:

1. **If component violations are found**: Recommend fixing violations first before cleaning up deprecated CSS
2. **If no violations but deprecated CSS exists**: Offer options to remove, save, or ignore deprecated CSS
3. **If no violations and no deprecated CSS**: Confirm the directory is clean and ready

### Integration with Main Flow

While this rule operates independently, it can inform the main refactoring flow:

- **Before Main Flow**: Use to assess overall migration scope and readiness
- **During Planning**: Reference findings to understand global impact
- **After Refactoring**: Use to verify cleanup completeness
