import { Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';

import * as BadgeStories from '../badge.component.stories';

The `DsBadge` component provides a way to display badges with various sizes, variants and additional features such as icons or placeholders (like success icon in our case).
You can make icon movable with properties slot for start and end position.

<Canvas of={BadgeStories.Default} />

## Usage

Import `DsBadge` in your component and apply `ds-badge` selector in your template.

```ts
import { DsBadge } from '@frontend/ui/badge'; // ðŸ‘ˆ add to file imports

@Component({
  imports: [DsBadge], // ðŸ‘ˆ add to component imports
  template: `...`,
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

## Badge variants

- By default, badges don't have any icons attached and are set in medium size and in primary variant
- Badges with icon are available only in xsmall and medium sizes
- Badges with icon are available only in xsmall and medium sizes
- Badges with icon are available only in medium sizes
- Badges with success icon are available only in xsmall and medium sizes
- Badges with both icon and success icon are available only in xsmall and medium sizes

---

## Accessibility

- The host sets `role="img"` for screen reader compatibility (interim solution until NVDA-compatible alternative is found).
- The `aria-label` is automatically generated from the badge text content.
- If `disabled` is true, the label is prefixed with `"Disabled badge: "`.
- Otherwise, it's `"Badge: {text}"`.

## Test Coverage

The component is comprehensively tested using Angular CDK Testing and a custom `DsBadgeHarness`.

### Functional Behavior

- Retrieves and verifies label text content
- Filters badges by:
- `size` (e.g., `'xsmall'`, `'medium'`)
- `variant` (e.g., `'secondary'`)
- label using a regex matcher
- Validates dynamic input changes:
- Updates to `size` correctly toggle size class
- Changes to `variant` are reflected in DOM state

### Slot Content

- Verifies rendering of text in the `[slot=start]` and `[slot=end]` containers
- Confirms SVG elements are supported and rendered in the start slot

### State & Styling

- Verifies toggling of the `inverse` class using `inverse` input
- Confirms `ds-badge-disabled` class presence when `disabled` is set

### Accessibility

- Checks that the computed `aria-label` accurately reflects the text and disabled state
- Validates screen reader output using `@guidepup/virtual-screen-reader`
