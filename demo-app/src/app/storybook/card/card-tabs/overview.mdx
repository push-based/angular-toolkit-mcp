import { Canvas } from '@storybook/blocks';

import * as CardStories from '../card.component.stories';

The `DsCard` component provides a flexible container for displaying content with optional header and footer sections.
Cards can be styled with different variants and sizes, and can be made interactive for clickable use cases.

<Canvas of={CardStories.Default} />

---

## Usage

Import `DsCard` in your component and apply `ds-card` selector in your template.

```ts
import { DsCard } from '@frontend/ui/card'; // ðŸ‘ˆ add to file imports

@Component({
  imports: [DsCard], // ðŸ‘ˆ add to component imports
  template: `...`,
})
export class AppComponent {}
```

---

## Card variants

- By default, cards have a default appearance with medium size
- Four visual variants are available: default, elevated, outlined, and filled
- Three size variants control the overall spacing: small, medium, and large
- Cards can be made interactive with the `interactive` property for clickable behavior
- Optional header and footer sections can be enabled with `hasHeader` and `hasFooter`

---

## Accessibility

- Interactive cards automatically receive `role="button"` and appropriate tabindex
- The `aria-disabled` attribute is set when the card is disabled
- Interactive cards are keyboard accessible when enabled
- Proper focus management is handled for interactive states

---

## Test Coverage

The component is comprehensively tested using Angular CDK Testing and a custom `DsCardHarness`.

### Functional Behavior

- Renders content in the main card area
- Conditionally displays header and footer sections based on inputs
- Handles interactive behavior with proper ARIA attributes
- Filters cards by:
  - `size` (e.g., `'small'`, `'medium'`)
  - `variant` (e.g., `'default'`, `'elevated'`)
  - `interactive` state

### Content Projection

- Verifies content projection for main content area
- Tests header content projection with `[slot=header]`
- Tests footer content projection with `[slot=footer]`

### State & Styling

- Verifies dynamic class application based on size and variant
- Confirms `ds-card-disabled` class presence when `disabled` is set
- Validates `ds-card-interactive` class for interactive cards

### Accessibility

- Checks that interactive cards have proper role and tabindex
- Validates aria-disabled attribute for disabled states
- Confirms keyboard accessibility for interactive cards
