You are tasked with creating a comprehensive refactoring plan for migrating legacy markup to a single design-system component. This plan should cover templates, class TypeScript files, styles, NgModules, and specs surfaced by the usage graph. Follow these instructions carefully to generate the plan:

1. Review the following input variables:
<component_name>
{{COMPONENT_NAME}}
</component_name>

<subfolder>
{{SUBFOLDER}}
</subfolder>

<violations>
{{VIOLATIONS}}
</violations>

<scan_result>
{{SCAN_RESULT}}
</scan_result>

<file_scan>
{{FILE_SCAN}}
</file_scan>

2. Acquire reference material:
   a. Call the function get-component-docs with the component name as the argument.
   b. If there's an error or no docs are found, output a commentary message and stop.
   c. Parse the docs to create a dsExemplar object containing markup, required parts, optional parts, and API information.

3. Map dependencies and impact:
   a. Call the function build-component-usage-graph with the subfolder as the argument.
   b. If there's an error or any violation file is missing from the graph, output a commentary message and stop.
   c. Derive working sets for host templates, classes, styles, specs, and modules.

4. Generate baseline contracts:
   a. For each host template, call the build_component_contract function.
   b. If there's a contract build error, output a commentary message and stop.

5. Analyze refactorability:
   a. Compare each violation instance with the dsExemplar markup.
   b. Classify as "non-viable", "requires-restructure", or "simple-swap".
   c. Record template edits, CSS clean-up, and ancillary edits.
   d. Calculate complexity scores.
   e. Aggregate results into filePlans.

6. Synthesize and output the plan:
   a. Sort filePlans by complexity score, violation count, and file path.
   b. Generate the plan in the following format:

<plan>
[For each file in filePlans, include:
- File path
- File type (template|class|style|spec|module)
- Refactor class (non-viable|requires-restructure|simple-swap)
- Actions to take (bullet points for template edits, TS updates, style removal, NgModule changes, spec tweaks)
- Complexity score]
</plan>

7. After the plan, ask the following question:
üõ†Ô∏è Approve this plan or specify adjustments?

Important reminders:
- Maintain NgModule-based structure (no stand-alone conversion).
- Generate contracts only for host components (template + class).
- Output must be minimal: a single <plan> block followed by one question.
- All other messages or errors should be enclosed in <commentary> tags.
- Ensure every host module needing a new import appears in filePlans.
- Ensure every host spec appears in filePlans (even if action="none").
- Verify that dsExemplar was referenced at least once.

Your final output should consist of only the <plan> block and the follow-up question. Any additional comments or error messages should be enclosed in <commentary> tags.
